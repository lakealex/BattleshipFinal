Battleship

#1 The first major iteration adds new types of weapons for the players. Both being able to be used once, there are two special shots
Shot #1 (obliterator) - Instantly sinks a ship if marked a hit
Shot #2 (Pulse cannon) - hits all neighboring squares of the selected square

The Second major iteration is adding powers distinct to each ship
Carrier - When hit for the first time, will be marked a a miss. The miss is then turned to a hit when the ship is hit for a second time
Battleship - When hit, will return fire at a random square on the opponents side
Cruiser - When sunk, the player will lose their ability to fire the pulse cannon, if it has not already been used
Submarine - When sunk, will randomly hit one of the opponents active ships
Destroyer - When sunk, the player will lose their ability to fire the obliterater, if it has not already been used
